# Escape Room

## A Choose-Your-Path Game 

***What will the application do?***

The application will provide users with a series of scenarios, emulating a character stuck in a room, forced
to use the items around them to escape. Users will pick one out of two options, dictating what they want their character 
to do. The next scenario you are faced with will depend on your answer to the previous. Throughout each scenario, 
you will encounter items that can be added into your inventory to aid your escape. Depending on your choice of 
actions, users will either successfully escape the room or fail. 

Users can also save the state of their game, and load it from file to return to a previous checkpoint. As the user exits 
the game, an event log is printed of all the items they have acquired in their inventory. 

***Who will use it?***

This application will be used by those looking for a simple, fun activity to pass their time. Choose-your-path games 
are of interest to many people because it allows the user to make their own decisions and have control over their
character. It is fun to explore the various paths you will embark on depending on the answer you pick. 

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

Growing up, I played a multitude of choose-your-path games. I find their creativity and versatility really appealing 
and to this day, I find myself searching for more. I aim to dedicate my project towards an application I would enjoy 
and play myself.
